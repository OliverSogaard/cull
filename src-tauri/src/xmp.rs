//! XMP sidecar I/O for CULL ratings.
//!
//! CULL writes Lightroom-Classic-compatible flags + a star, verified against
//! real LrC 15.3 sidecars (`sample_cr3s/sample_LrCFlaggedCR3s`):
//!
//! ```text
//!   reject   → xmpDM:pick="-1"  xmpDM:good="false"
//!   keep     → xmpDM:pick="1"   xmpDM:good="true"
//!   favorite → xmpDM:pick="1"   xmpDM:good="true"  + cull:fav
//! ```
//!
//! The pick flag means "survived the cull". Favorites carry a CULL-private
//! `cull:fav` marker (see `CULL_NS` below): "star" = CULL added a courtesy 1★ to a
//! frame with no user rating; "flag" = the favorite rides the user's existing
//! 1–5★ and `xmp:Rating` is left untouched. The marker disambiguates CULL's
//! favorite stamp from a user's Lightroom star (they used to collide at
//! `xmp:Rating="1"`). Stars 2–5 are the user's LrC edit-pass ratings and are
//! NEVER touched by CULL. The pick/good flags ride in the xmpDM (Dynamic Media)
//! namespace exactly as LrC writes them, so picks / rejects / favorites
//! round-trip into Lightroom and back.
//!
//! ## Invariant
//!
//! Only the `{basename}.xmp` sidecar is ever written — the CR3 itself is never
//! modified. All writes go through [`atomic_write_xmp`] (temp + rename), so a
//! crash mid-write can't leave a half-file on disk.
